Any unit within 1 panel radius of you joins the battle on your team, and any unit within 1 panel radius of target joins their team.

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_XMAS2018_INSTRUCTION_07 >
Snowball battles last for 3 rounds of attack and defense, or until everyone on one party has been hit.

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_XMAS2018_INSTRUCTION_08 >

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_XMAS2018_INSTRUCTION_09 >
When attacking, predict where the opponent will try to dodge, and try to hit them. Success gives you half their snow!

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_FRB2019_INSTRUCTION_02 >
Use the stored Pig Hearts to unlock pig costumes in the Shop, freeing that character from the curse of pigformation!

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_FRB2019_INSTRUCTION_03 >

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_SPRING2019_INSTRUCTION_02 >

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_SPRING2019_INSTRUCTION_05 >
Play in 1 of the 3 character roles: Attacker, Guardian or Supporter. Each role gains experience when you play with them, and will unlock new, powerful abilities.

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_SPRING2019_INSTRUCTION_06 >
Build your Co-op deck freely using the new Deck Point system! More powerful cards cost more Deck Points to bring with you. Remember that all cards are used by you and your allies.

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_SPRING2019_INSTRUCTION_07 >
Note that many characters' Hyper cards work differently in Co-op! You can toggle between regular and Co-op cards in the Binder to look at the effects in detail.

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_SPRING2019_INSTRUCTION_08 >
Your Deck Point pool is determined by your character rating. A-ranked characters are considered most fitting for that role, and start with 10 Deck Points. 

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_SPRING2019_INSTRUCTION_09 >
Characters with a lower rating for each role have more Deck Points to compensate. Experiment with different character/role combinations!

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_SPRING2019_INSTRUCTION_10 >
Bosses move on the field and can attack you! They only activate movement-related panels (Move, Warp etc.) Always keep their location in mind for your tactics.

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_SPRING2019_INSTRUCTION_11 >
The boss has a deck of 5 unique cards ranging from level 0 to 3. After playing all 5, boss upgrades one of the lowest level cards to a higher level one and their deck is shuffled.

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_SPRING2019_INSTRUCTION_12 >
Boss ability is revealed at the beginning of each chapter, and boss activates it before their turn at the end of the chapter, so plan accordingly!

// Instruction about the game mode button
< PLAYMENU_EVENT_SPRING2020_INSTRUCTION_01 >
To play the Bounty Hunt mode, toggle between Normal, Co-op and Bounty Hunt when creating a new lobby or starting a single player game.

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_SPRING2020_INSTRUCTION_02 >
A new Norma type has been added, which is the only Norma available for this mode: Fame. (Note: characters with Norma restrictions can still complete Fame Norma in this mode).

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_SPRING2020_INSTRUCTION_03 >
You can increase your Fame by completing quests or bounties. Quests and bounties are acquired by stopping at any Home panel, where you will have the option to select a contract.

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_SPRING2020_INSTRUCTION_04 >
Quests require you to go to the location shown on the contract in order to fetch an item, then delivering the item to a shop marked with an arrow.

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_SPRING2020_INSTRUCTION_05 >
Bounties require you to hunt the monster shown on the contract and will give a varying amount of Fame depending on their difficulty.

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_SPRING2020_INSTRUCTION_06 >
Monsters can be found all over the field, and Bounty battles will last for up to 10 rounds. Make sure to gear up before you get into the fight!

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_SPRING2020_INSTRUCTION_07 >
To help you fight the monsters infesting the land, in this mode all characters have a permanent +1 MOV and gain additional stars every chapter!

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_SPRING2020_INSTRUCTION_08 >
Quest locations and shops with various useful items appear over the field. You can stop at any shop in order to buy items and even sell cards!

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_SPRING2020_INSTRUCTION_09 >
Note that your characters' stats affect your shop prices - the less powerful characters get big discounts you can utilize for different strategies!

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_SPRING2020_INSTRUCTION_10 >
A hazy Mirage will appear somewhere on the field, marking the panel the next cleared location will move to. The move instantly happens if a bounty monster is defeated or a shop gets sold out. Then a new panel is marked.

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_SPRING2020_INSTRUCTION_11 >
Upon completing your Norma, you'll be able to select one of several perks presented at random. These are permanent and vary from stat bonuses to lower shop prices, etc.

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_SPRING2020_INSTRUCTION_12 >
The first time a player reaches Norma 3, an Invader will hit the field. Invaders are enemies with unique abilities that disrupt the game in various ways. Taking them down gives you a bonus!

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_SPRING2020_INSTRUCTION_13 >
A strong new boss will appear when a player reaches Norma 4. Beware of its power! 6 Fame will be given to whoever brings it down!

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_SUMMER2020_INSTRUCTION_MAIN >
It's time for a riverside party! Help Saki, Nath and Kae catch fish for their BBQ!

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_SUMMER2020_INSTRUCTION_01 >
To participate in the event, select the Fish-a-Fish game mode when starting a game.

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_SUMMER2020_INSTRUCTION_02 >
A new minigame will trigger every 10 chapters. All players will participate in it at the same time!

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_SUMMER2020_INSTRUCTION_03 >
Cast your hook with the left click of your mouse to catch fish. Look underwater to find the fish you want by moving your mouse around.

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_SUMMER2020_INSTRUCTION_04 >
After selecting a spot, your hook will sink down to the bottom, and you will automatically reel up the first fish or piece of junk in its way.

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_SUMMER2020_INSTRUCTION_05 >
Each fish has their own weight and speed. Catch fast or big fish to gain more score!

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_SUMMER2020_INSTRUCTION_06 >
The minigame may speed up randomly. This includes both fish speed and your own hook speed.

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_SUMMER2020_INSTRUCTION_07 >
All players are ranked by their fish score at the end of the fishing phase. Players will be rewarded with Wins based on their ranking and stars based on score.

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_SUMMER2020_INSTRUCTION_08 >
Pay attention to the grill! It always has a set of 3 fish to catch, and catching them all scores an extra 15 points!

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_SUMMER2020_INSTRUCTION_09 >
Everyone has their own grill to fill, so try to complete more sets than your opponents within the time limit!

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_SUMMER2020_INSTRUCTION_10 >
Furthermore, catching the same fish type several times in a row will give extra Combo points toward your score.

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_SUMMER2020_INSTRUCTION_11 >
Your total fishing score from each game is counted toward your event progression. Let's have a great meal!

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_SUMMER2020_INSTRUCTION_COMPLETE >
You did it! Saki, Nath, and Kae can now enjoy their BBQ party by the river! But if you're still hungry for more, you can keep fishing!

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_FALL2020_INSTRUCTION_01 >
To participate in the event, toggle between Normal and Shroom Zoom mode when creating a new lobby or starting a single player game.

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_FALL2020_INSTRUCTION_02 >
You can also play normal games with the Spores field event active to participate. Note that the frequency of mushrooms is lower as a field event.

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_FALL2020_INSTRUCTION_03 >
Every 2 chapters (or 3 in normal mode), mushrooms will spawn on random panels. You can pick them up by stopping on a panel that has one.

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_FALL2020_INSTRUCTION_04 >
Upon picking up a mushroom, you receive a card with a random effect. The effects are only revealed when you use them, and are randomized each game.

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_FALL2020_INSTRUCTION_05 >
Legendary mushrooms will appear after the first player reaches Norma level 4! Only one can be picked up in a single game.

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_FALL2020_INSTRUCTION_06 >
The special mushrooms give a powerful Gift card when picked up, which can be stolen by other players if they KO the previous owner.

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_FALL2020_INSTRUCTION_07 >
The progress of the event will increase depending on which legendary mushroom was picked up during that game.

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_FALL2020_INSTRUCTION_08 >
Who will win the mushroom war? Only time will tell...

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_FALL2020_INSTRUCTION_COMPLETE >

In addition, players start with boots that grant +1 to MOV and can be upgraded to even better versions in the Shops.

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_WINTER2020_INSTRUCTION_11 >
Extra stars can be earned by selling cards to a shop. Different shops may offer different prices for the cards!

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_WINTER2020_INSTRUCTION_14 >
Moreover, a mysterious Harbinger may appear after chapter 15 and begin to hunt the players. Being defeated by it gives the player -1 Fame, and increases the amount of Fame defeating the Harbinger gives.

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_WINTER2020_INSTRUCTION_COMPLETE >
Cook has been fed and the journey is beginning! But you can still keep playing Bounty Hunt to unlock bonus event rewards on your way.

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_SUMMER2021_INSTRUCTION_MAIN >

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_SUMMER2021_INSTRUCTION_02 >

Each game mode also has additional ways to collect decorations.

In normal mode, you will gain a decoration by visiting another player's Home Panel. You also gain decorations based on your ranking at the end of the match.

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_HALLOWEEN2021_INSTRUCTION_04 >
In Co-Op you will gain a decoration from KO'ing a Boss minion. You also gain decorations based on the Boss difficulty upon victory.

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_HALLOWEEN2021_INSTRUCTION_05 >
In Bounty Hunt, you will receive a decoration from visiting a marked Shop. You also gain decorations based on your ranking at the end of the match.

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_HALLOWEEN2021_INSTRUCTION_06 >
You can collect up to 4 decorations per match along with the reward from match results.

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_HALLOWEEN2021_COMPLETE >
The house has been decorated and it's time to enjoy your handiwork with friends! You can still keep collecting more decorations for unlocking costumes in the Shop.


< PLAYMENU_EVENT_CHAOS_INSTRUCTION_MAIN >
Chaos has been unleashed! Play with a selection of various game mutators in the new Chaos Mode during the Fool's Gambit event.

To play with mutators, toggle between Normal and Chaos Mode when creating a lobby or starting a single player game.\nYou may then select the desired mutator.

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_CHAOS_INSTRUCTION_02 >
Some mutators have game rewards or achievements disabled for balancing reasons. You can check that in the mutator's description.

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_CHAOS_INSTRUCTION_03 >
This event does not have an ending or unique rewards. By playing in the Chaos Mode, you'll instead receive one Arcade Token at the end of each game, up to 20 per day.

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_CHAOS_INSTRUCTION_04 >
It's time to break all the rules! Embrace the chaos!

Movement points will automatically be used to travel along the chosen path until a crossroads.\nIt's up to you which path you will take on the journey.

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_PTS_INSTRUCTION_05 >
Passing certain panels will grant you stars, oranges, a random cosmetic or even an event reward!

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_PTS_INSTRUCTION_06 >

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_PTS_INSTRUCTION_COMPLETE >
You have reached the shrine! However, you may repeat the trek as many times as you want for even more rewards.


< PLAYMENU_EVENT_WINTER2022_INSTRUCTION_MAIN >
Christmas cakes around the world are in danger! We must search far and wide and dispose of Mio's abominable cakes!

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_WINTER2022_INSTRUCTION_01 >
A special "Mio's False Cake" card will be added to every player's hand every 6 chapters.

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_WINTER2022_INSTRUCTION_02 >
To safely dispose of this foul creation, either consume it (at your own peril) for a random effect, or throw it at an opponent to deal 1 damage.

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_WINTER2022_INSTRUCTION_03 >
Playing event games in any game mode will reward you tasty Christmas cakes which can be used in the Shop to unlock rewards. The event can be toggled off when creating a game.

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_WINTER2022_INSTRUCTION_04 >
The event is successful when all of Mio's "cakes" have been safely disposed of by players all around the world.

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_WINTER2022_INSTRUCTION_05 >
The two event counters correspond to the method of disposing of the cakes, and either can be used to progress toward the ending.

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_WINTER2022_INSTRUCTION_06 >
To unlock the event's ending, you must reach your personal goal of event games played, which will also give you a prize independent of the global event progress.

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_WINTER2022_COMPLETE_01 >
The world has been saved! Everyone can happily enjoy tasty Christmas cakes again instead of whatever that was! You can still keep searching for leftover cakes. 

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_WINTER2022_COMPLETE_02 >

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_SUMMER2023_INSTRUCTION_MAIN >
We're surrounded! Help Ellie and Lulu fight off hordes of aggressive Mousse to get your hands on the promised treasure!

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_SUMMER2023_INSTRUCTION_01 >
Play games in the Treasure Tails event mode or Bounty Hunt mode to fight Mousse!

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_SUMMER2023_INSTRUCTION_02 >
Treasure Tails is an adjusted version of Bounty Hunt game mode with several key differences including lower Norma, 50% cheaper shop prices, and extra +1 hand size.

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_SUMMER2023_INSTRUCTION_03 >
The 3 Bounties available are always Mousse (easy), Key Lime Mousse (medium) and Strawberry Mousse (hard).\nDefeat any of them to progress in the event!

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_SUMMER2023_INSTRUCTION_04 >
In addition, completing a Quest will trigger a bounty fight against a 2 HP Mousse instead of granting 2 fame immediately. 

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_SUMMER2023_INSTRUCTION_05 >
Finally, a new invader, Dark Chocolate Mousse, will doom players' stars instead of their lives...\nDefeating Dark Chocolate Mousse grants 3 points of progress in the event.

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_SUMMER2023_INSTRUCTION_06 >
What are the Mousse guarding, and why...?

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_SUMMER2023_INSTRUCTION_COMPLETE >
You have found the "treasure" Ellie was seeking for... but what is going on now?

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_WINTER2023_INSTRUCTION_02 >
You will gain 3 Memory Fragments for your first game of the day, and an additional Memory Fragment every game.

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_WINTER2023_INSTRUCTION_03 >
One Memory Fragment allows you to progress one panel on the event map.

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_WINTER2023_INSTRUCTION_04 >
Memory Fragments will automatically be used to travel along the chosen path until a crossroads.\nIt's up to you which path you will take on the journey.

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_WINTER2023_INSTRUCTION_05 >
Passing certain panels will grant you stars, oranges, or a random cosmetic!

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_WINTER2023_INSTRUCTION_06 >
Can you recall those memories and help Lulu conquer her darkness?

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_WINTER2023_INSTRUCTION_MAIN2 >
The final battle awaits! Defeat Mio in the Extra Mission "Divine Punishment"!

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_WINTER2023_INSTRUCTION_COMPLETE >
You have overcome the bad ending laid out by the god of the world! An endless journey lies ahead! You may continue on to collect more rewards.

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_SEASON3LAUNCH_INSTRUCTION_MAIN >
Duke it out over a delicious meal at Family Restaurant Pures! Regular customers earn loyalty rewards!

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_SEASON3LAUNCH_INSTRUCTION_01 >
For the duration of this event, players will be able to play a new game mode: Tag Team!

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_SEASON3LAUNCH_INSTRUCTION_02 >
You can get a stamp on your Family Restaurant Pures Loyalty Card by playing a game of Tag Team, or 2 games in other game modes! 

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_SEASON3LAUNCH_INSTRUCTION_03 >
In Tag Team, you'll be able to choose an additional character as a Partner to accompany you in games.

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_SEASON3LAUNCH_INSTRUCTION_04 >
You can choose to Tag on your turn to switch places between the characters you have selected. The Leader character will then exchange places with your Partner!

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_SEASON3LAUNCH_INSTRUCTION_05 >
Once you Tag, you won't be able to do so again for 3 chapters. Decide carefully before using it!

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_SEASON3LAUNCH_INSTRUCTION_06 >
If the Leader ends up getting KO'd, they'll be forced to Tag if their Partner is not KO'd as well. This will put the Tag action on cooldown, so be careful out there!

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_SEASON3LAUNCH_INSTRUCTION_07 >
Your Partner will recover HP automatically after a certain amount of chapters pass. If they are KO'd, they will recover after an amount of turns equal to their REC stat passes.

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_SEASON3LAUNCH_INSTRUCTION_08 >
Hovering over your Partner's portrait will show when the next occurrence of their recovery will be.

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_SEASON3LAUNCH_INSTRUCTION_09 >
Any card effects your partner currently has will not have their duration decreased.

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_SEASON3LAUNCH_INSTRUCTION_10 >
If your partner has any unit effects that would affect the game, their effects will NOT be active unless they return back onto the field.

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_SEASON3LAUNCH_INSTRUCTION_11 >
Effects that apply to self after recovering from KO will still apply to your partner once KO recovery takes place.

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_SEASON3LAUNCH_INSTRUCTION_12 >
Plan out your best tag team and become the local 100% Orange Juice champion!
